Binary Classifier that draws a line to separate two different categories. Basic Machine Learning algorithm.

*The line depicts the model's prediction on how it should draw to classify the two objects into separate categories, red being unuseable tools and green being useable*
*The new predictoin is based on the values of Para1 (useful feature) and Para2 (not useful feature)*
